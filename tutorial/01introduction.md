# The Standard Model Tutorial

<p>This tutorial gives some of the gory details of how the Standard Model works. The intended audience are advanced users of Cascade CMS. What are assumed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced knowledge and skills in Velocity, including knowledge on how to work with service providers</li>
<li>Medium-level knowledge in web services</li>
<li>Some Java programming knowledge</li>
</ul>
<h2>Library Code</h2>
<p>In order to show how everything works, I do not always use the Upstate Velocity Library directly in the tutorial. Instead, we will rebuild some of the library code bit by bit, and use it to perform whatever task we are set to perform. The whole point is to show how the library code was built. Of course, the code for the exercises shown here still comes essentially from the Library.</p>
